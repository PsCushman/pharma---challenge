# pharma-challenge

I uploaded files via the drag method to make sure there were no issues. This is a resubmission so I didn't want to take any chances. .

I recieved help in a couple places.

First, I found the duplicate mouse mostly on my own, but asked a LA the right way to use the .isin command. Then, when going over it with my tutor, we talked about some alternate ways to code it and they were so cool that I had to keep them. Most notably when we used the '~' when removing the duplicate mice rows, essentially creating a 'not in' command.

Secondly, I was having trouble finding the correct outlier because I was not running my for loop on full data. I got help from a LA to fix the problem.
